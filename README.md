	* Flask
	* SQLAlchemy
	* PostgreSQL

## FrontEnd Overview

### React
Using React as the frontend application allowed me to leverage not only React but the tools that come along with it like different types of hooks

<div style="width:360px;max-width:100%;"><div style="height:0;padding-bottom:47.22%;position:relative;"><iframe width="360" height="170" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameBorder="0" src="https://imgflip.com/embed/4q99vw"></iframe></div><p><a href="https://imgflip.com/gif/4q99vw">via Imgflip</a></p></div>

### Redux
Redux allowed me to create a better way to manage my state throughout my application. By managing the state through the store I can update multiple components that rely on the same information.


## Material UI Icons
Material UI Icons are used for the navigation bar Icons. 

## CSS
CSS styling is used for the styling throughout the page. Using grids makes it easier to space the profile and exlore page.

## Backend Overview

### Flask
The python web framework flask is used for the backend.  Flask is a great lightweight framework to use because it allows for easy integration with PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy ORM. For a smaller application it is an effective framework to use becauase it isn't to difficult to set up and comes with some handy tools like flask-login.

### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL was a great RDBMS to use. Its fairly simple to integrate it with the Flask framework and store different reltionships between models.
